====supplication=====

Supplication is one of the most powerful tools for driving away evil,
hindrance=obstacle,Impediments
affliction=great suffering

Supplicate to Allah when you are assured of being answered, and know that Allah does not
answer a supplication which comes from a careless and inattentive heart.
Supplication is the weapon of a believer; it is the pillar of Islam, and the light of the heavens and earth.

Onlysupplication averts the decree, only kindness prolongs life,
and a man is deprived of provision for a fault he commits

He who does not ask Allah, earns His Anger.

Allah loves those who persist in supplicating to Him.

Everyone's supplication will be answered, as long as one is
not hasty, and says: 'I made my supplication but it was not
answered.

Any Muslim who makes a supplication, containing
nothing which is sinful or which involves breaking ties of
relationship, will be receive one of three things by Allah: He
will give him a swift answer, or store it up for him in the
next world, or remove from him an equivalent amount of
evil.
